Python Turtle Curves
====================

This repo contains a few example Python Turtle programs, each of which draws a parametric curve from Wolfram Alpha's library of curves.

 - `parametric_converter.py` takes a parametric curve and converts it to valid Python
 - All other files are curve examples
